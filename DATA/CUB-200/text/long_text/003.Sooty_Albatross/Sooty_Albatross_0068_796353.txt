The bird in the image is a large, gray seagull with a black beak. It has a distinctive gray and black wing, which is spread wide as it flies through the air. The bird's tail is also gray, and its feathers are visible as it soars through the sky. The seagull appears to be flying high above the clouds, creating a striking contrast against the backdrop of the sky.
