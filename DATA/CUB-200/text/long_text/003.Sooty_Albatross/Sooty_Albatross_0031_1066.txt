The bird in the image is a large, dark-colored bird with a long beak. It has a brown body and a white wing, which contrasts with its dark feathers. The bird is flying through the air, with its wings spread out, and its tail is visible as it soars. The bird's feathers are well-defined, and it appears to be a seabird, possibly a pelican or a similar species.
