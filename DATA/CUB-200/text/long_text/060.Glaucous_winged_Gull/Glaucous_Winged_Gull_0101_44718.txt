The bird in the image is a large gray and white seagull. It has a yellow beak and is standing on a wooden surface, possibly a pier or a fence. The seagull's wings are spread out, and its tail is fanned out, giving it a majestic appearance. The bird's feathers are well-groomed, and it appears to be in good health.
