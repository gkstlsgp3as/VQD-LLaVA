The bird in the image is a seagull, which is a white bird with gray feathers. It has a yellow beak and is standing on a rocky surface. The seagull is holding a piece of food in its mouth, possibly a small fish or a piece of bread. Its wings are spread out, and it has a long tail that extends downwards. The bird's feathers are well-groomed, and it appears to be in good health.
