The bird in the image is a seagull, which is a large white bird with gray feathers. It has a long beak, which it is using to pick at something on the ground. The bird's wings are spread out, and its tail is fanned out as it stands on the ground. The seagull's feathers are wet, indicating that it might have been in the water recently.
