The bird in the image is a seagull, which is a white and gray bird. It has a yellow beak and yellow legs. The seagull is standing in the muddy water, with its wings spread out, possibly to dry them. The bird's tail is also visible, and it appears to be standing on one leg. The seagull's feathers are wet, indicating that it has been in the water for some time.
