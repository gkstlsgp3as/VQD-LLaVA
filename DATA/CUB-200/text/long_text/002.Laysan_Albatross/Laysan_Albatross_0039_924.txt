The bird in the image is a large seagull with a white and brown body. It has a long beak, which it is using to hold onto a fish in its mouth. The bird's wings are spread out, and it appears to be flying or preparing to take off from the water. The seagull's tail is also visible, and its feathers are well-defined, giving it a distinctive appearance.
