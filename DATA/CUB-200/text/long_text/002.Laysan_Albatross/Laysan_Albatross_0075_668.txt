The bird in the image is a seagull, which is characterized by its white and black feathers. The bird has a long, pointed beak and large, broad wings that are spread out as it flies through the sky. The tail of the seagull is also visible, with its feathers splayed outward. The bird appears to be flying high in the sky, possibly enjoying the wind currents or searching for food.
