The bird in the image is a large seagull with a white and brown body. Its wings are spread wide, and it has a long beak. The bird is flying over a body of water, possibly the ocean, with its wings partially submerged in the water. The seagull's tail is also visible as it flies through the water. The bird's feathers are well-defined, and it appears to be enjoying its flight over the water.
