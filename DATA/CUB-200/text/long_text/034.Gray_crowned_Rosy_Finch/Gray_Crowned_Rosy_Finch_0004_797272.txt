The bird in the image is small and brown, with a white patch on its head. It has a beak that is slightly open, and its wings are spread out, possibly for balance or to dry them. The bird's tail is also visible, and it appears to be perched on a rock. The bird's feathers are well-groomed, giving it a neat appearance.
