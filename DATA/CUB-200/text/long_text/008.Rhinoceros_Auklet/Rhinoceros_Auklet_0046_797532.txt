The bird in the image is a black bird, possibly a seagull, floating on the water. It has a long beak, which is a typical feature of seagulls. The bird has a wing spread out, which indicates that it is either preparing to take flight or has just landed on the water. The bird's tail is also visible, and it appears to have a feathered body, which is common among seagulls.
