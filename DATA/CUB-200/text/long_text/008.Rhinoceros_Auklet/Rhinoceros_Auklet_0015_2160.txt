The bird in the image is a black and white bird, likely a seagull, floating on the water. It has a long beak, which is typical for birds that feed on fish or other aquatic creatures. The bird's wings are spread out, possibly to help it maintain balance or to dry its feathers. The tail of the bird is also visible, and its feathers appear to be wet, indicating that it has been in the water for some time.
