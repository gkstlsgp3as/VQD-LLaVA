The bird in the image is a hummingbird, which is characterized by its small size, iridescent green and white feathers, and a long, slender beak. The hummingbird is hovering in the air near a red feeder, which is specifically designed to attract these birds. The feeder is shaped like a flower, and the hummingbird is perched on top of it, likely feeding on the nectar inside.
