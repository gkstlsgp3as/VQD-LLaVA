The bird in the image is a black and white bird with a distinctive orange beak. It has a black wing and a black tail, which contrast with its white feathers. The bird is floating on the water, possibly a lake, and appears to be looking at the camera. The combination of its black and white feathers, orange beak, and the way it is floating on the water make it a unique and eye-catching sight.
