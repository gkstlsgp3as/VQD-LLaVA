The bird in the image is a small, black bird with a yellow beak. It has a long neck and is swimming in a body of water, possibly a lake. The bird's wing is partially submerged in the water, and its tail is visible as it swims. The bird's feathers are likely to be wet from the water, giving it a shiny appearance.
