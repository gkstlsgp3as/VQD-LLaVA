The bird in the image is a black and gray duck floating on the water. It has a yellow beak, which stands out against its dark feathers. The duck's wing is partially submerged in the water, and its tail is visible as it swims. The bird's feathers are well-defined, and it appears to be enjoying its time on the water.
