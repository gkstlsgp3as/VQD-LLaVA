The bird in the image is a large, gray and white bird with a black beak. It has a wide wingspan, which it is currently spreading out while standing on the water. The bird's tail is also visible, and it appears to be a waterfowl, possibly a duck or a goose. The bird's feathers are well-groomed, and it seems to be enjoying its time on the water.
