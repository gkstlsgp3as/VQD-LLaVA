The bird in the image is a duck, floating on the water with its head up. It has a brown body, a white and black wing, and a long beak. The duck's tail is also visible, and it appears to be swimming in a lake. The duck's feathers are likely to be waterproof, which helps it stay buoyant and dry while in the water.
