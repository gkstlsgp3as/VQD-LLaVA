The bird in the image is a brown duck with a white patch on its head. It is swimming in a body of water, possibly a lake or a pond, with its head above the water. The duck has a long neck, which is typical for this species. Its wings are partially submerged in the water, and its tail is visible as it swims. The duck's feathers are well-groomed, giving it a sleek appearance.
