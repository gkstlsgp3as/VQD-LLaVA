The bird in the image is a duck with a brown body and a black head. It has a long beak, which is typical for ducks. The duck is floating on the water, and its wings are spread out, possibly for swimming or to maintain balance. The tail of the duck is also visible, and its feathers are well-groomed, giving it a neat appearance.
