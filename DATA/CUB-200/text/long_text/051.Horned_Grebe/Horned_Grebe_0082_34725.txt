The bird in the image is a small, gray and white bird with a black beak. It has a distinctive red patch on its face, which adds a pop of color to its otherwise muted appearance. The bird is floating on the water, with its wings partially submerged, and its tail feathers are visible as it glides across the water. The bird's feathers are well-groomed, giving it a sleek and polished look.
