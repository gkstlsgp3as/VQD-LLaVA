The bird in the image is small and black, with a yellow head. It is perched on a wire, possibly a telephone wire, and appears to be looking down. The bird has a beak and wings, which are typical features of birds. Its tail is also visible, and it has feathers that help it maintain its balance while perched on the wire.
