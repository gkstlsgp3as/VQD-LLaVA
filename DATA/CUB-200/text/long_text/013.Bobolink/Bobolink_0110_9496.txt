The bird in the image is small and perched on a tree branch. It has a black and yellow beak, which stands out against its white and black feathers. The bird's wings are also black and white, and its tail is black. The bird appears to be looking up, possibly observing its surroundings or searching for food. The branch it is perched on is thin, and the bird's position on it adds to the overall composition of the image.
