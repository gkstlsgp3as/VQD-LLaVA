The bird in the image is a small, black and white bird with a brown beak. It has a black wing and a black tail, which contrast with its white feathers. The bird is perched on a thin tree branch, and its position suggests that it is looking upward. The bird's feathers are well-groomed, giving it a neat appearance.
