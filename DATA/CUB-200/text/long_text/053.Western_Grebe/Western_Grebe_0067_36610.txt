The bird in the image is a large, black bird with a white chest. It has a long, slender neck and a yellow beak. The bird is floating on the water, with its wings spread out to the side. Its tail is also visible, and it appears to be a waterfowl, possibly a duck or a goose. The bird's feathers are well-maintained, and it seems to be enjoying its time in the water.
