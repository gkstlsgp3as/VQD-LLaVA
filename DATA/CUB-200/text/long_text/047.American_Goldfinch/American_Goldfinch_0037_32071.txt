The bird in the image is small and white, with a yellow head and a black beak. It is perched on a tree branch, which is bare and appears to be a part of a leafless tree. The bird's wing is folded, and it has a tail that is visible as it sits on the branch. The bird's feathers are well-groomed, giving it a neat appearance.
