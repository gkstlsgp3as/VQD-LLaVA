The bird in the image is a small, yellow bird with a black beak. It has a black wing and a black tail, which contrast with its yellow feathers. The bird is perched on a brown surface, possibly a tree branch or a bird feeder. Its position on the branch or feeder suggests that it is either resting or looking for food.
