The bird in the image is a large, black bird with a long tail. It has a black beak and is standing on top of a rusty metal object, which appears to be a piece of machinery or a rusted pipe. The bird's feathers are black, and it seems to be perched on the rusted surface, possibly resting or observing its surroundings.
