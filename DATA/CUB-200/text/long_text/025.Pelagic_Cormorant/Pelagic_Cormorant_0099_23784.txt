The bird in the image is a black bird with a long beak. It is floating on top of the water, with its wings spread out to the side. The bird's tail is also visible, and it appears to be a sea bird, possibly a duck or a goose. The bird's feathers are likely to be waterproof, as it is comfortably floating on the water.
