The bird in the image is a white bird with a black beak. It has a small, delicate body and a pair of wings that are spread out to the sides. The bird's tail is long and pointed, and its feathers are fluffed out, providing insulation against the cold. The bird is standing on a snow-covered ground, possibly a frozen lake or a snow-covered field.
