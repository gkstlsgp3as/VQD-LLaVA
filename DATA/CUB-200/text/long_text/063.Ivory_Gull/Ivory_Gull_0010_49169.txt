The bird in the image is a large white bird with a black beak. It has long, white wings that are spread wide as it flies through the air. The bird's tail is also white, and its feathers are white, giving it a pristine appearance. The bird is flying over a snow-covered ground, creating a beautiful contrast between its white feathers and the white snow.
