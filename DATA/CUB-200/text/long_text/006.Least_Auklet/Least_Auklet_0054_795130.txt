The bird in the image is a black and white bird, possibly a seagull, with a white beak. It has a wing that is spread out, and its tail is also visible. The bird is perched on a rock, which is covered in moss and algae. The bird's feathers are black and white, creating a striking contrast against the green background of the rock.
