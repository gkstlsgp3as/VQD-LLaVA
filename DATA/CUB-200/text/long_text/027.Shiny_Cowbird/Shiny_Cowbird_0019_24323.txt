The bird in the image is a large, wet bird with a brown body and black wings. It has a long, skinny beak and a long tail. The bird is perched on a thin, bamboo-like stick, which it is holding onto with its feet. The bird's feathers are wet, possibly from rain or water, and it appears to be looking up into the sky.
