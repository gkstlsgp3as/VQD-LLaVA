The bird in the image is a small, gray bird with a black wing. It has a beak and is walking across a grassy field. The bird appears to be a sparrow, which is known for its small size and gray coloration. The bird's wing is spread out as it walks, and its tail is visible as it moves through the grass. The bird's feathers are well-groomed, giving it a neat appearance.
