The bird in the image is a brown duck with a black wing. It is floating on a body of water, possibly a lake, and appears to be looking at its reflection. The duck has a beak, which is a common feature among birds, and its feathers are visible as it swims. The duck's tail is also visible, as it swims through the water.
