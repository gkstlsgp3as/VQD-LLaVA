The bird in the image is a brown duck with a white wing and tail. It has a long beak and is floating on the water. The duck is surrounded by a calm, blue lake, and its reflection can be seen on the water's surface. The bird's feathers are well-groomed, and it appears to be enjoying its time in the water.
