The bird in the image is a small, brown duck with a black head. It is floating on a body of water, possibly a lake, and appears to be looking at its reflection. The duck has a white patch on its wing, which is visible as it floats on the water. Its tail is also visible, and it seems to be enjoying its time in the water.
