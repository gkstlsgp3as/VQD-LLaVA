The bird in the image is a small, brown bird with a white beak. It has a wing spread wide, possibly in the process of taking flight or landing on the water. The bird's tail is also visible, and it appears to be a duck or a similar type of waterfowl. The bird's feathers are well-defined, and it seems to be enjoying its time on the water.
