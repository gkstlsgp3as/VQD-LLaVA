The bird in the image is a small, brown duck with a white tail. It is swimming in a body of water, possibly a lake, and appears to be looking at something in the water. The duck has a long neck and a beak, which is typical for ducks. Its feathers are visible, and it seems to be enjoying its time in the water.
