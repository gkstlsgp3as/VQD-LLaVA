The bird in the image is a black and brown duck. It has a brown head and a black body, with a white patch on its wing. The duck is floating on the water with its wings spread out, and it appears to be looking at the camera. Its beak is slightly open, and its tail is visible as it swims. The duck's feathers are well-groomed, giving it a neat appearance.
