The bird in the image is a small, brown, and white duck. It has a brown body with white feathers on its wings, which are partially visible as it swims in the water. The duck's beak is yellow, and it appears to be looking upward. The bird is swimming in a body of water, possibly a lake, and its reflection can be seen on the water's surface.
