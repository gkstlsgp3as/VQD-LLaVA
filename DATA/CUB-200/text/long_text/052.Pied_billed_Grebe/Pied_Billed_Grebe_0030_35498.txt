The bird in the image is a small, brown duck with a white tail. It has a brown head and a yellow beak. The duck is swimming in a body of water, possibly a lake or a pond. Its feathers are ruffled, giving it a fluffy appearance. The duck's wing is partially submerged in the water, and it appears to be looking at its reflection.
