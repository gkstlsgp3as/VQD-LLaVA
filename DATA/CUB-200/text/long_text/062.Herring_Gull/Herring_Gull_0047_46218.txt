The bird in the image is a white and gray seagull. It has a black beak and black wingtips. The bird is perched on a rope or a twisted rope, which could be part of a net. The seagull's tail is visible, and it appears to be standing on a rock or a similar structure. The bird's feathers are well-defined, and it looks like it is staring at something in the distance.
