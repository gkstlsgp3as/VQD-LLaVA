The bird in the image is a seagull, which is a large white bird with gray and black feathers. It has a yellow beak and is standing on a wooden post or fence near the water. The seagull's wings are spread out, and it appears to be looking out over the water. The bird's tail is also visible, and it seems to be enjoying its time near the ocean.
