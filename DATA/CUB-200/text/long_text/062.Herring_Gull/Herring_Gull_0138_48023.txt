The bird in the image is a seagull, which is a large white bird with gray feathers. It has a yellow beak and is standing on a concrete ledge near the water. The seagull's wings are spread out, and its tail is fanned out, giving it a majestic appearance. The bird's feathers are well-groomed, and it appears to be looking at the camera.
