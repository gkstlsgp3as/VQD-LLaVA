The bird in the image is a white seagull, which is a large white bird with a yellow beak. It has a distinctive black wing and a long tail. The seagull is perched on top of a headstone in a cemetery, surrounded by other headstones. The bird's feathers are white, and it appears to be standing on a stone monument in the graveyard.
