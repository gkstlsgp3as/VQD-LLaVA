The bird in the image is a seagull, which is a large white bird with black and grey feathers. It has a grey beak and is perched on top of a white object, possibly a light pole or a building. The seagull's wings are spread out, and its tail is visible as it sits on the object. The bird appears to be looking at something in the distance, possibly scanning for food or observing its surroundings.
