The bird in the image is a large seagull with a gray body and a white head. It has a long, pointed beak and wide, gray wings that are spread out as it flies over the water. The bird's tail is also gray, and its feathers are distinctly visible as it soars through the air. The seagull appears to be in flight, possibly searching for food or simply enjoying the freedom of flight.
