The bird in the image is a seagull, which is a large gray and white bird. It has a long, pointed beak and a distinctive gray and white feather pattern on its body. The seagull's wings are spread wide, and its tail is visible as it flies through the air. The bird appears to be flying over a body of water, possibly a lake or ocean, with ice chips floating on the surface.
