The bird in the image is a seagull, which is a large white bird with gray feathers. It has a long beak and is standing on a pile of ice. The seagull's wings are spread out, and it appears to be perched on the ice with its tail feathers visible. The bird's feathers are well-adapted to the cold environment, providing insulation and protection from the harsh weather conditions.
