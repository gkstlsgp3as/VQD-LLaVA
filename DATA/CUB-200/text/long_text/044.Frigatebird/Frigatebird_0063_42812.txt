The bird in the image is a large, white bird with a black beak. It has a black wing and a black tail, which contrast with its white body. The bird is perched on a tree branch, surrounded by thorny branches and green leaves. The bird's feathers are visible, and it appears to be a tropical bird, possibly a seagull, given its size and coloration.
