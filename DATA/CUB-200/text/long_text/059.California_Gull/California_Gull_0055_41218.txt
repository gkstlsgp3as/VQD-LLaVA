The bird in the image is a seagull, which is a large white bird with a yellow beak. It has a distinctive wing shape, with one wing spread out wide and the other wing folded in. The seagull's tail is also visible, and it has a long, pointed tail feather. The bird is flying over a body of water, possibly a lake, and its wings are flapping as it soars through the air.
