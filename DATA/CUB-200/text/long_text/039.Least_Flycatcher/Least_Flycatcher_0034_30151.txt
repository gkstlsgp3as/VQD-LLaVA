The bird in the image is small and white, with a brown beak. It has a striped pattern on its wings and tail, which adds to its unique appearance. The bird is perched on a tree branch, sitting comfortably and looking around. The branch appears to be thin, providing a delicate balance for the bird as it rests on it.
