The bird in the image is a black crow, standing in a grassy field. It has a black beak and black wings, which contrast with its black feathers. The crow's tail is also black, and it appears to be looking up into the sky. The bird is standing on the grass, which is a mix of green and brown, and it seems to be enjoying its time outdoors.
