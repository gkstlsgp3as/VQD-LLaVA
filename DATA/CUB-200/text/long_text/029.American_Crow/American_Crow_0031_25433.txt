The bird in the image is a black crow, which is perched on a wooden fence or ledge. It has a black beak and black wings, which are spread out to the side. The crow's tail is also black, and its feathers are shiny and well-groomed. The bird appears to be looking at something on the ground, possibly a small animal or an insect.
