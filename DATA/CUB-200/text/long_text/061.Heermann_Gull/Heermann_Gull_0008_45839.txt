The bird in the image is a large, gray and white seagull. It has a white head and a red beak. The bird is perched on a green metal railing, which could be a part of a fence or a bridge. The seagull's wings are spread out, and its tail is visible as it stands on the railing. The bird's feathers are well-defined, and it appears to be staring into the distance.
