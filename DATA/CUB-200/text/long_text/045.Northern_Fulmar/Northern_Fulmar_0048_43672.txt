The bird in the image is a seagull, which is a large white bird with black beak and yellow beak. It has a grey wing and a grey tail. The bird is flying over a body of water, possibly a lake, with its wings spread wide. The seagull's feathers are visible as it soars through the air, creating a striking contrast against the backdrop of the water.
