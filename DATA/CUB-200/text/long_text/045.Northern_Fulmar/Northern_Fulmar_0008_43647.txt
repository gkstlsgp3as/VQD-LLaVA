The bird in the image is a seagull, which is a large gray bird with a white belly. It has a long, pointed beak and a gray wing. The seagull's tail is also gray, and its feathers are spread out as it flies through the air. The bird is flying over a body of water, possibly the ocean, and appears to be enjoying its time in the open air.
