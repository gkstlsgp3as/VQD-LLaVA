The bird in the image is a seagull, which is a large white bird with a gray wing. It has a gray and white feathered body, and its wings are spread wide as it flies through the air. The seagull's beak is black, and it has a long tail that extends behind it. The bird is flying over a body of water, possibly the ocean, and its wingspan is quite impressive, covering a significant portion of the image.
