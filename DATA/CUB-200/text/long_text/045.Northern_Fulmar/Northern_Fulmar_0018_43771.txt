The bird in the image is a seagull, which is a large white bird with black wingtips. It has a yellow beak and is flying through the air with its wings spread wide. The seagull's tail is also visible as it flies above the water. The bird's feathers are well-defined, and it appears to be in motion, soaring gracefully through the air.
