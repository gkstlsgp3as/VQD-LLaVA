The bird in the image is a seagull, which is a large black and white bird. It has a black wing and a black tail, with white feathers on its body. The bird is flying over a body of water, possibly the ocean, and its wings are spread wide as it soars through the air. The seagull's beak is black, and it appears to be flying with ease and grace.
