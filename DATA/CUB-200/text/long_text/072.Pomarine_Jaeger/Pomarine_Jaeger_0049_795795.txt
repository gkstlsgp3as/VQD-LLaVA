The bird in the image is a small, gray and white bird with a black beak. It is floating on the water, possibly a lake, with its wings spread out. The bird's tail is visible, and it appears to be enjoying the sunlight as it glides across the water. The bird's feathers are likely to be waterproof, allowing it to stay afloat and comfortable in the water.
