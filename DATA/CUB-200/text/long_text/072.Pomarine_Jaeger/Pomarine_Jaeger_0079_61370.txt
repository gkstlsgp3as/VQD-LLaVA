The bird in the image is a large black and white bird, possibly a seagull, flying through the sky. It has a black wing and a black tail, with white feathers on its body. The bird's beak is black, and it appears to be flying with its wings spread wide. The bird's feathers are spread out, creating a striking contrast against the sky.
