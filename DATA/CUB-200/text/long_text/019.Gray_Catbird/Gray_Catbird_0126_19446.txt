The bird in the image is a small, gray bird with a black beak. It has a gray wing and a gray tail, which are both slightly curved. The bird is perched on a brick wall, standing on one leg, and appears to be looking at something. Its feathers are well-groomed, and it appears to be a healthy and well-cared-for bird.
