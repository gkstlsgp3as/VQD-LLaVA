The bird in the image is a small hummingbird with a long beak. It has a red and orange color, with a white belly. The bird is perched on a red feeder, which is likely designed to attract hummingbirds. The bird's wings are folded, and it is sitting on the edge of the feeder, possibly preparing to drink from it.
