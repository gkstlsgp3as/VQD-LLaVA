The bird in the image is a black and yellow bird, likely a finch, standing on a wooden surface. It has a black wing, a yellow chest, and a black tail. The bird's beak is black, and it appears to be perched on the wooden surface, possibly a picnic table. The bird's feathers are well-defined, and it seems to be looking at something in the distance.
