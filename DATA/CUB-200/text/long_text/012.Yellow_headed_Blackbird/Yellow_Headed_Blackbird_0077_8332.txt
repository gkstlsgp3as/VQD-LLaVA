The bird in the image is a black and yellow bird, possibly a goldfinch, with a yellow head and black wings. It is standing on a paved surface, possibly a road or a sidewalk, and appears to be walking or standing still. The bird's beak is black, and its feathers are black and yellow, creating a striking contrast against the paved surface.
