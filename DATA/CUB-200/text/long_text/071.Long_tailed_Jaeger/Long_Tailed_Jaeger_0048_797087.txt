The bird in the image is a large seagull with a white and black body. It has a long, pointed beak and a wide, grey wing that spans across the image. The bird's tail is also visible, and it appears to be flying through the air with its wings spread wide. The bird's feathers are well-defined, and it seems to be enjoying its flight in the open sky.
