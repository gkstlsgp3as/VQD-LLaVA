The bird in the image is a large, gray seagull with a white head. It is floating on the water with its wings spread out, creating a striking contrast against the blue water. The bird's beak is visible, and its tail is partially submerged in the water. The seagull's feathers are wet, indicating that it has been swimming or diving in the water.
