The bird in the image is a large, dark-colored bird with a long, pointed beak. It has a wide wingspan, with one wing spread out to the side and the other wing partially folded. The bird's tail is also visible, and it appears to be flying or gliding through the water. The bird's feathers are likely to be waterproof, as it is flying over the water.
