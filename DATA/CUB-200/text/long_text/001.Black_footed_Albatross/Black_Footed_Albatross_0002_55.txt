The bird in the image is a large, dark-colored bird with a long beak. It has a brown body, and its wings are spread out as it floats on the water. The bird's tail is also visible, and it appears to be a seabird, possibly a duck or a goose. The bird's feathers are likely water-resistant, allowing it to stay afloat and navigate the water with ease.
