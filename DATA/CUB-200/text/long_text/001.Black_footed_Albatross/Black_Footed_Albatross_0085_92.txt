The bird in the image is a large seagull with a white head and a black beak. It has a grey body and black wings, which are spread wide as it flies through the air. The bird's tail is also black, and its feathers are visible as it glides over the water. The seagull appears to be flying over a large body of water, possibly the ocean, as it enjoys its time in the open air.
