The bird in the image is small and gray, with a long tail that extends downwards. It has a beak and a wing, which are visible in the close-up shot. The bird is perched on a thin tree branch, which is located in a clear blue sky. The bird's feathers are well-defined, and it appears to be a bird of prey, possibly a hawk or a falcon.
