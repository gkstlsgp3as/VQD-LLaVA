The bird in the image is a large, black bird with a long beak. It has a wing that is spread out, and its tail is hanging down. The bird is standing on a dock or a wooden platform, possibly near the water. Its feathers are wet, which might suggest that it has recently taken a bath or has been in contact with water.
