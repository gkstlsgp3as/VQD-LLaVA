The bird in the image is a black bird with a long beak. It is floating on the water, possibly a lake, and appears to be looking at the camera. The bird has a wing that is partially submerged in the water, and its tail is also visible. The bird's feathers are likely to be smooth and shiny, as it glides through the water.
