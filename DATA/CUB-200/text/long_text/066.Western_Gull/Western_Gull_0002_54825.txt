The bird in the image is a white seagull with a black beak. It has a gray wing and a black tail. The seagull is standing on a metal surface, possibly a roof, and appears to be looking up into the sky. The bird's feathers are visible, and it appears to be a large bird, as it covers most of the metal surface.
