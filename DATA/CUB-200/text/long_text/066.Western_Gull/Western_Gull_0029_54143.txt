The bird in the image is a large seagull with a white and gray body. It has a yellow beak and legs, and its feathers are well-groomed. The seagull is standing on a rock near the water, possibly on a pier. Its wings are spread out, and it appears to be looking at the camera. The bird's tail is also visible, adding to its overall appearance.
