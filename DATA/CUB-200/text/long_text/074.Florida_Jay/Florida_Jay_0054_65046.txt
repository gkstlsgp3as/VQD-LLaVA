The bird in the image is a blue jay, which is a small, colorful bird with a blue body and a white chest. It has a long, pointed beak and a blue tail. The bird is perched on a wooden fence, standing on one leg with its wings tucked in. The feathers on its body are blue and white, creating a striking contrast against the wooden fence.
