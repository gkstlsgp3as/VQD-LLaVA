The bird in the image is a blue and gray bird, perched on a tree branch. It has a blue head and a gray body, with a long tail that extends downwards. The bird's wing is also blue, and it appears to be a small bird, possibly a songbird. The bird is sitting on a thin tree branch, which is likely to be a part of a tree with green leaves.
