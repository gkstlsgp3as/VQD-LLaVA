The bird in the image is a blue jay, which is a small, colorful bird with a blue body, a white belly, and a gray head. It has a long tail, and its wings are spread out while it perches on a tree branch. The bird is holding a small insect in its beak, possibly a grasshopper, and it appears to be eating it.
