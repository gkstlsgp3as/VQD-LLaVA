The bird in the image is a black bird, possibly a crow or a blue jay, perched on a metal bowl filled with birdseed. The bird has a black beak and black feathers covering its body. Its wings are spread out, and its tail is black. The bird appears to be standing on the rim of the bowl, possibly eating the birdseed.
