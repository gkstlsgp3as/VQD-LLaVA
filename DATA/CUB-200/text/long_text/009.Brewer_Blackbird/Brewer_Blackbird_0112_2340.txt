The bird in the image is a small, gray-colored bird with a black wing. It has a long tail, which is also black. The bird is standing on the grass, looking to the left. Its beak is open, and it appears to be staring at something in that direction. The bird's feathers are well-groomed, giving it a neat appearance.
