The bird in the image is a black and white bird, possibly a penguin, standing on a rock. It has a black beak and black wings, which contrast with its white body. The bird's tail is also black, and it has black and white feathers. The bird is perched on a rocky surface, possibly a cliff, and appears to be looking out into the ocean.
