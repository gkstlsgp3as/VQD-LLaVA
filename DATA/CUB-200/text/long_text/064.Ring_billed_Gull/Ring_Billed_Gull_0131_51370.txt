The bird in the image is a seagull, which is a white and gray bird. It has a yellow beak and is perched on a white concrete structure, possibly a fence or a post. The seagull has a gray wing and a gray tail, and its feathers are white and gray as well. The bird appears to be standing on one leg, which is a common behavior for birds to conserve energy.
