The bird in the image is a white seagull, standing in shallow water near the shore. It has a long beak, which is typical for seagulls, and its feathers are white and gray. The seagull's wings are spread out, and it appears to be looking at the camera. The bird's tail is also visible, and it seems to be standing in the water with its feet submerged.
