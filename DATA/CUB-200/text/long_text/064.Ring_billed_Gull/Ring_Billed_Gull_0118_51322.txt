The bird in the image is a seagull, which is a white and gray bird. It has a yellow beak, and its feathers are speckled with gray. The seagull is standing on a snow-covered surface, possibly a beach or a snowy hill. Its wings are spread out, and it appears to be looking at something in the distance. The bird's tail is also visible, adding to its overall appearance.
