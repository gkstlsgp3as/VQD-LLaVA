The bird in the image is a seagull, which is a large white bird with gray and brown feathers. It has a long, pointed beak, which is typical for seagulls. The bird is standing on a rock in the water, with its wings spread out, possibly to dry them or to maintain balance. The seagull's tail is also visible, and its feathers are wet, indicating that it has been in the water.
