The bird in the image is a seagull, which is a large white bird with gray wings. It has a long beak and is flying over a body of water, possibly a lake. The seagull's wings are spread wide, and it appears to be in the process of landing on the water. The bird's feathers are visible, adding to its distinctive appearance.
